    <p class="about-me-text">
      Howdy! I'm Brenndan Croteau, class of '25 at Texas A&M University. I grew up in a city just to the northeast of San Antonio called 
      Universal City. I attended Veterans Memorial High School and graduated 3rd in my class of over 340 students. Throughout high school, 
      I participated a lot in musical organizations. I was the woodwind captain of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/veteranshsband/">marching band</a>, lead alto for the jazz ensemble, and 
      lead alto for the concert band. During my time here, I created the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vmhssaxophones/?hl=en">school 
      Instagram page</a> for the saxophones, which still runs to this day. These organizations are what I believe shaped me into the 
      individual I am today. These experiences allowed me to learn leadership skills, learn how to dedicate myself to a passion and learn 
      how to fit in with those around me. Following high school, I decided I wanted to attend Texas A&M, where I plan to graduate with a 
      Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a minor in Statistics.

  <div id="about-me-cont">
    <p class="about-me-text"> 
      Outside of school, I love both watching and playing sports. I'm a huge Dallas sports fan, so I love the Dallas 
      Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Texas Rangers. I'm willing to have a conversation with anyone about almost any sport. I also 
      love pets. The sweet kitty in the picture is my cat Autumn who lives with me here in College Station. My family has many 
      more pets back home, but Autumn stays with me. We have a grand total of five pets in our house back in San Antonio. One place that I 
      have begun to appreciate is the gym. Working out has been a recently discovered hobby that I really believe has changed my life. It 
      gives me more energy, makes me more confident, relieves stress, and overall increases my happiness. I'd recommend it to everyone if 
      they have the free time. I hope you enjoyed listening to me talk about myself, and I hope you enjoy the rest of my website.
