      During my senior year of high school, I agreed to mentor younger students at Kitty Hawk Middle School to try and brighten the future 
      of my high school program. Since my band class was my first class of the day, I would drive to the middle school early around 6:30 AM to 
      work with them for roughly an hour before classes started. I had a wonderful experience doing this and I hope to have impacted these 
      students positively.

      My school district had little to no options to study computer science prior to graduation, which disappointed me as I knew it was the 
      field I would like to enter when I was to get a job. Because of this, I would love to host a camp of some sort similar to 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/ptstny/home?authuser=0">Upperline Code</a> at my old high school, 
      <a href="https://www.judsonisd.org/VeteransMemorial">Veterans Memorial High School</a>. My goal is to give students an opportunity that I was not given and expose them to the ideas of 
      computer science before they have to commit to it at university.
